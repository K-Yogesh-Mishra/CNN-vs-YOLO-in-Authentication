# CNN-vs-YOLO-in-Authentication

Authorization of Moving Personnel
Implement a system that can distinguish between authorized and unauthorized personnel moving around comatose patients. This objective involves training the surveillance system to recognize and classify healthcare staff, visitors, or other individuals based on predefined authorization criteria, contributing to enhanced securityÂ measures. We are implementing CNN and YOLO algorithm and then compared the results.
